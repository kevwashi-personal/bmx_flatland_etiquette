# BFEaC
BMX Flatland Etiquette as Code

BFEaC is an Open Source project to define BMX Flatland etiquette through machine-readable definition files.

## Description

BFEaC provides the yaml file, bmx_flatland_etiquette.yaml that defines the essential characteristics of proper BMX Flatland etiquette.

## Usage

### Add bmx_flatland_etiquette.yaml as a Knowledge Source for a Custom Gem

This method incorporates the YAML file as a persistent source of information that a custom Gem will use for all interactions, without needing to upload it each time. 

1. Go to gemini.google.com and go to the "Create Gem" or "My Gems" section. This requires a Google One AI Premium plan or Gemini for Workspace.
2. Provide instructions for the custom Gem, including how to use the YAML file.
3. Look for the Knowledge source section or "Add file" button within the Gem's configuration interface.
4. Upload the YAML file as a knowledge source, either from a local drive or from Google Drive.
